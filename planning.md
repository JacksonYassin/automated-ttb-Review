### Start
 
Start with something that can process in an image and determine if the five following requirements are met:

1. Brand Name
2. Name and Address (domestic)(imports)
3. Class/Type
4. Net Contents
5. Alcohol Content


### Web Dev
Use streamlit as super easy final thing. It shouldn't take very long to get everything looking pretty on this front. 

### For improving accuracy
Easy OCR actually seems pretty good. Maybe an LLM + Easy OCR appraoch is the move.

### Different label requirements
1. There are different requirements for each label. 

### What needs to get operationalized

Is what needs full operationalization.
